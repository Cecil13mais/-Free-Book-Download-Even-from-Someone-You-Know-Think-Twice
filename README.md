# -Free-Book-Download-Even-from-Someone-You-Know-Think-Twice
A family member recently received a link from someone they know personally, offering a free eBook. The link directed them to a third-party site that required converting and downloading a file — immediately suspicious.

Before clicking, they asked me to investigate.

I analyzed the link and files in a safe, isolated environment:

✅ No malware was detected using sandbox analysis and VirusTotal.

🚩 However, the site used multiple redirects, involved an unknown conversion service, and forced a download — all red flags for phishing or social engineering.

I advised them not to download or run anything.

Why this matters:
🔒 In an enterprise environment, this type of event is a common initial attack vector. Users clicking on “harmless” downloads can lead to:

Device compromise

Credential theft

Ransomware infections

Data breaches

Even links sent by trusted contacts may be compromised. Always:

Verify the source

Inspect the URL

Pause and ask if something feels “off”

This was a safe escape, but also a reminder:

🧠 Think before you click — especially when it feels “almost legitimate.”
